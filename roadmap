I want you to think like a senior systems architect and product designer.

Your task is to design a full architecture, roadmap, and working principle for a self-hosted AI-powered photo gallery application, similar to Google Photos, Immich, Apple Photos, and Prism.

DO NOT write any code. Do NOT generate files. Focus on deep system thinking, feature breakdown, conceptual flows, and architectural clarity.

### GOAL:
Design the entire system for a future production-ready application that can run locally first (on macOS), and later be deployed on a Raspberry Pi or Linux server. All photos must be stored locally (USB, SSD, or external drive).

### BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Use **Ruby on Rails** as the main backend framework.
- Use **PostgreSQL** as the database.
- Support background jobs (Sidekiq or Rails ActiveJob).
- Include a separate AI worker service (Python recommended) for face detection, tagging, and photo analysis.
- API must be clean and ready for mobile + web.

### CORE FEATURES:
- Photo upload (local network first).
- Local storage of all originals + generated thumbnails.
- EXIF metadata extraction.
- Albums, tags, search, filters.
- AI features including:
  - Face detection + face grouping (clustering)
  - Scene/object tagging
  - Duplicate detection
  - Photo similarity search
- Local-first design (privacy focused).
- Optional remote access later.

### STORAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Ability to store photos on:
  - macOS filesystem
  - external USB drive (pendrive/HDD/SSD)
  - Raspberry Pi mounted drive
- Must support S3-compatible storage in future (MinIO).

### INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- First run on **Docker on macOS** for development.
- Later deploy on a **Raspberry Pi**, with arm64-compatible containers.
- Clear explanation of how Docker binds to local storage paths (no code).
- LAN accessibility (same Wi-Fi network) before enabling public routing.
- Future public access via domain + reverse proxy.

### OUTPUT FORMAT (VERY IMPORTANT):
Create a structured, well-written document containing:

1. **Product Description**
   - What the app is
   - Who it is for
   - Why it is useful

2. **System Overview**
   - All components and how they interact
   - Rails backend role
   - AI worker role
   - Database role
   - Storage subsystem
   - Background job pipeline
   - API / Web / Mobile clients

3. **Architecture Diagram (text-only)**
   - Show the flow between all components

4. **Data Model Outline**
   - Tables/entities (no schema, just conceptual fields)

5. **AI Processing Pipeline**
   - How faces are processed
   - How clusters are created
   - How tags are generated
   - How duplicate detection works

6. **Storage Strategy**
   - How photos are stored
   - How Rails accesses local files
   - How Docker volumes work conceptually
   - How this maps to Raspberry Pi external drives

7. **Networking**
   - How the app is accessed locally on LAN
   - How the server exposes itself
   - High-level plan (no commands) for enabling remote access later

8. **Performance Considerations**
   - Running AI on Raspberry Pi (tradeoffs)
   - Offloading heavy AI tasks
   - Caching thumbnails

9. **Security & Privacy**
   - Local-first privacy model
   - Authentication and permissions
   - Recommended best practices

10. **Migration Plan**
   - macOS local → Raspberry Pi
   - How to adapt storage paths
   - How to adapt containers
   - High-level deployment steps

11. **Development Roadmap**
   - Step-by-step phases from MVP → production app
   - Focus on sequence: storage, upload, metadata, AI, UI, etc.

12. **Business Naming**
   - Suggest strong brandable product names suitable for a future business

### RULES:
- DO NOT generate any code of any kind.
- DO NOT reference filenames or code structure.
- Keep everything high-level and conceptual.
- Assume unlimited technical capability, but optimize for simplicity.
- The answer should read like a professional architectural planning document for a future product.

Begin.
